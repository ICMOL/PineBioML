    bug:
        1. bagging:
             - contradicts to log domain in selection method (the negative output of pca)
             - the variance of feature will change during bagging (variance matters)
        2. logistic regression + L1 grid search need to to modified. In temporary using binary search.
    to do:
        1. add parameter dict(json or yaml-like)
        2. report
        n. interactive interface or GUI (maybe nicegui/ plotly)

        2. selection result with volcano plot
        3. default parameter change:
            i. normalizer will all do scaling and centering
            ii. random_forest pruning (ccp_alpha = 1e-2)
            iii. essemble will activate 8 method: dt, svm, lasso, multi-lasso, adaboost, xgboost, lightgbm, random_forest-gini
        4. implement random_forest with oob + permutation importance.
            i. single processing implement
            ii. permutation method is super slow: O(n_trees* n_feature* n_repeat) ~ O(n_feature^2* n_repeat)
        5. an optuna example of svm.
