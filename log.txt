    On going:
        1. auto ml (auto sklearn, mljar, H2O)

    bug:
        1. bagging:
             - contradicts to log domain in selection method (the negative output of pca)
             - the variance of feature will change during bagging (variance matters)
    to do:
        1. add parameter dict(json or yaml-like)
        2. report
        n. interactive interface or GUI (maybe nicegui/ plotly)
