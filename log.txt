        1. Deprecate log in normalizer
        2. update readme.md
        _ fix lasso
        _ fix plotting 

    bug:
        1. Linear Lasso has bug to fix, substitude by bisection Lasso (solved)
        2. plotting function (solved)
        3. bagging:
             - contradicts to log domain in selection method (the negative output of pca)
             - the variance of feature will change during bagging (variance matters)
    to do:
        1. auto ml
        2. document (on going)
        3. report
        n. interactive interface
